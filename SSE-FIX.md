# Server-Sent Events (SSE) Fix

## Problem
The SSE connections were timing out after long periods, causing real-time updates to stop working. Users would see "ðŸ”´ Connecting..." and wouldn't receive live updates.

## Root Causes
1. **Long heartbeat interval**: 30 seconds was too long - many proxies/load balancers timeout before that
2. **No automatic reconnection**: When connection dropped, it never reconnected
3. **No error handling**: Network issues weren't properly handled
4. **Potential buffering**: Some reverse proxies (nginx) buffer SSE by default

## Solutions Implemented

### Server-Side (`/app/api/events/route.ts`)
1. **Reduced heartbeat interval**: From 30s â†’ 15s to prevent timeouts
2. **Added `isActive` flag**: Prevents sending to closed connections
3. **Improved cleanup**: Better resource management on disconnect
4. **Added anti-buffering header**: `X-Accel-Buffering: no` for nginx compatibility
5. **Enhanced error handling**: Graceful handling of send failures

### Client-Side (`/app/page.tsx`)
1. **Automatic reconnection**: Reconnects after 3 seconds if connection drops
2. **Connection state management**: Proper cleanup on unmount
3. **Console logging**: Debug messages for connection status
4. **Error recovery**: Handles network failures gracefully
5. **Visual feedback**: 
   - Green pulsing dot when connected
   - Orange bouncing dot when reconnecting
   - Changed text from "Connecting..." to "Reconnecting..."

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Connection**: Client connects to `/api/events`
2. **Heartbeat**: Server sends heartbeat every 15 seconds
3. **Data Updates**: When votes change, all connected clients receive updates
4. **Connection Drop**: If connection fails:
   - Client detects error
   - Shows "ðŸŸ  Reconnecting..." with bouncing indicator
   - Attempts reconnection after 3 seconds
   - Repeats until successful
5. **Cleanup**: Properly closes connections on page navigation

## Testing
- Open browser console (F12) to see connection logs
- Look for: "SSE Connected" when working
- Network tab should show persistent `/api/events` connection
- Multiple tabs should all receive updates simultaneously

## Browser Compatibility
- All modern browsers support EventSource (SSE)
- Automatic reconnection works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- IE11 not supported (requires polyfill)
